<h1>Step 1: Create the Web API (Backend)</h1>
<p>In this step you are going to lay the foundation for all the other steps. You will develop a server application that allows for the management of parking spaces. For this, we are going to use Microsoft's dotnet 5.0.</p>
<p>First, make sure you have all the prerequisites installed. Then go on to the implementation of the tasks. Make sure to read through the acceptance criteria before implementing anything.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>There are a few tools you need to install in order to complete the tasks in this issue. Check out the links section for download links.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code</strong>
<ul>
<li>You are free to choose which of these IDEs you want to use in your project. As we are working with the latest dotnet Framework, both IDEs fully support all features needed. If you are not sure what to use, we recommend Visual Studio.</li>
<li>If you are using Visual Studio, make sure to check the boxes for "Workload Web" in the Visual Studio installer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dotnet SDK</strong>
<ul>
<li>If you used the latest version of Visual Studio, you most likely already have the dotnet SDK installed. If not, make sure to download the newest version of it. Confirm you have the tool installed by typing `dotnet --version` in your Powershell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Git</strong>
<ul>
<li>At this point you surely have Git installed already. If not, it is high time to do so!<br>Throughout this whole project, use Git for version control.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Postman</strong>
<ul>
<li>In order to work with and test APIs, we usually use the GUI tool Postman. Make sure to install its latest version.<em>If you wish, you can of course use tools like curl or httpie, granted you already know how to use them.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>After having installed all the prerequisites, you are now ready to go on to the implementation of the car park's API. To define API specifications, we use the OpenAPI standard. We already specified the interface you are going to implement. Check out the link section. In this first issue, you are going to implement all methods except for the check-out endpoint.</p>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>First off, you are going to create a new solution. Next, you are going to create a few projects and add them to the solution.</p>
<ol>
<li>Training.Carpark.Api (Type: Web, will be referred to as "API project")</li>
<li>Training.Carpark.Services (Type: Class Library, logic layer, will be referred to as "services project")</li>
<li>Training.Carpark.Repositories (Type Class Library, persistence layer, will be referred to as "repo project")</li>
</ol>
<p>Add the following project references: 1 references 2, 2 references 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>API Project</h3>
<p>In the API project, add a new folder "Controllers" and create a new class "ParkingSpacesController" inside the folder. Make sure your class inherits from the standard class "Controller" and add the controller's route according to the API specification.</p>
<p>To configure the application to use your newly created controller, open the `Startup` class and add MVC core to the services. Next, change the configuration of `UseEndpoints` to map controllers. This will configure ASP.net to route requests entering your application to the correct controller.</p>
<p>Navigate back to the controller and add a method that handles an HTTP GET request and returns an OK status code (200) with the text "Hello World!". Then, run the API project. Use Postman to send a GET request to your application and verify that the response you get is "Hello World!" with a status code of 200.</p>
<p>After you have verified that your controller is working, remove the method you just created. Instead, add methods for all the operations defined in the API specification. You don't have to program the bodies of the methods just yet. Create all model classes in a "Models" namespace according to the structural guide (see link section). Use the standard library ´System.Text.Json´ to fix all JSON attribute names.<br><em>Remember, thecheck-out endpoint does not have to work yet.</em></p>
<p>To implement the methods of the controller, you are going to have to use a service class. We do not use specific instances of any classes of another projects, we use interfaces as a mean of abstraction. Each method of the controller requires a method in the service. Go on to the next section to create the interfaces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Interfaces</h3>
<p>Between all layers (API, service, repository/persistence), we use interfaces wherever a component of another project is used. This allows us to replace entire components and still ensure that the interface between the components remains the same.</p>
<p>In the service project, add a new interface `ICarparkService` and create methods for creating, updating (check-in) and deleting a parking space. Think not only about what kind of parameters the methods require, but also what return values makes sense for all the methods. <br>Use&nbsp;<em>tuple values&nbsp;</em>as return types to handle both, the request status and the real response object from the service, e.g. a list of parking spaces: (StatusCodeEnum.OK, allParkingSpaces).<br>Make sure to follow the structural guide for Docugate development (see link section), for example, put all the model classes into the "Models" namespace.</p>
<p>Do the same for a new interface `ICarparkRepository` in the repo project.</p>
<p>To use the service interface in the controller, we are going to make use of dependency injection. In the controller class, let ASP.net inject a service via the constructor. You can now pretty much already program the whole method bodies for the controller, even without having written any actual service code!</p>
<p>Go ahead and implement the controller methods now using the injected service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Service</h3>
<p>Next, you are going to create a new class ´CarparkService´ that implements the ´ICarparkService´ interface you created before. The CRUD operations pretty much just forward the controller's calls to the repository. Just like you did with the controller, use the service's constructor to inject an instance of ´ICarparkRepository´ to the service. You can now program the methods of the service to use the repository's methods and return values according to the results of the repository's operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Repository</h3>
<p>At this point you have already implemented a controller that handles HTTP calls, a service that gets called by the controller and a repository interface to define how communication between the service and the repository should look. Now, you need to make sure parking spaces actually get saved, can be updated and can be deleted.</p>
<p>To do so, create a new class that implements the repository interface. In this issue, we are going to use an in-memory database as a persistence. Hence, name your class something like ´InMemoryRepository´. Use model classes and a dictionary to store parking spaces in properties. In the read, update and delete operations, use this dictionary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chaining it all together</h3>
<p>To chain all three layers together, you need to extend the dependency injection's setup. Map the interfaces to the new classes you just created. After this, all layers should be implemented and you can run the application again.</p>
<p>Test the API via postman. Can you create a new parking space? Can you use the API to retrieve this parking spot? Can you delete it?</p>
<p>Use the PowerShell script provided to create all the parking spaces the car park has.</p>
<p>Restart the application and use Postman to get all parking spaces from your API. Is the list empty? It should be. Our repository for now stores all data in-memory. Later on, we are going to add actual persistence via MongoDB.</p>
