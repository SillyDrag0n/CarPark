# CarPark
The car park consists of three stories A, B and C, each of which has thirty parking spaces.

In each story there are multiple parking machines. 
After having parked the car, a customer has to get a ticket from the machine by entering the number of the parking spot used. 
The machine then sends the centralized management system a message that the parking space is occupied. This process is called check-in.

Before leaving the car park, a customer has to scan the ticket received upon arrival at the parking machine. 
The machine then requests a price calculation for the matching parking spot and requires the user to pay before printing the receipt. 
This process is called check-out.
